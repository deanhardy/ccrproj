# ccrproj
The code and data associated with this repository are for projecting populations using the Hamilton-Perry Method, or cohort change ratios (CCRs). 

The three scripts currently available in the repository must be run in sequence from p12.proj.cnty.R, then pct12.proj.cnty.R, then pct12.proj.trct.R. The input data for the second and third are dependent upon the outputs of the previous script.

For more details on CCR, see Baker et al, 2017. For details of this particular code, see our SocArXiv preprint: https://dx.doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/PKR75
